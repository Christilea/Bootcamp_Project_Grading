# Description
This project replicates how our projects are assigned and graded during
this class. Each assigned project includes: Title, Requirements, Due Date,
and categorized grading requirements with variable weights. Projects are
completed by teams of students who each receive individual grades based on
the rubrics. The tally of the assigned grades for each category, which
constitutes the rubric, provides each student with the score for their
submission; these scores should be then translated to a matching letter
grade.
